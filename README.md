### 0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

**Instructions:**

- Review the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend.
- Use Draw.io to create a detailed document that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support (user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments).
- Export the design as a PNG file and store it in the `features-and-functionalities` directory in your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
- Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
- Directory: `features-and-functionalities/`
- File: `README.md`

### 1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

**Instructions:**

- Based on the features outlined, use Draw.io to create a use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.
- File: `requirements.md`

### 2\. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

mandatory

**Objective:** Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**

- Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”
    
- Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.
    
- Create a file named `user-stories.md` in the directory `user-stories/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` and document your user stories there.
    
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository
    

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
- Directory: `user-stories/`
- File: `user-stories.md,README.md`

### 3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

**Instructions:**

- Design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.
- Export your diagram as a PNG file named `data-flow.png` and store it in a directory called `data-flow-diagram/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
- Directory: `data-flow-diagram/`

### 4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes

**Objective:** Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

**Instructions:**

- Choose one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.
- Export the flowchart as a PNG and store it in the `flowcharts` directory under the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` GitHub repository.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`
- Directory: `flowcharts/`
- File: `data-flow-diagram.png`
